# Live solutions to be synced to participants

This directory contains live solutions that can are synced to the participants' machines via git. Initially this directory will contain the same skeleton notebook files as the `code` directory. As we work our way through the turorial, we will add solutions to these skeletons in the directory and we will sync them to the `live_solutions` directory in this repository. By syncing the repository, participants' will thus be able to access a sample solution that grows as the tutorial progresses.
