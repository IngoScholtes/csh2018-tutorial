    "So far, we studied higher-order network models for path data with a fixed, given order $k$. We have seen that such higher-order models can yield better predictions compared to standard network models. But we also came across new questions: For the US Flight data, we could improve the prediction performance by moving from a first- to a second-order model. However, we did not see a further improvement for the third-order model. So in practice, how can we decide **at which order we should model a given system**? This points to a more general question as we can also imagine systems for which path statistics do not deviate significantly from the transitive, Markovian assumption made by a first-order model. So we **need methods to decide when higher-order models are actually needed**.\n",

    "Moreover, a higher-order model with order $k$ can only capture higher-order dependencies at a single fixed correlation length $k$.

However, based on the network topology, for the second step we have a choice between nodes $d$ and $e$.

The key idea is to combine multiple higher-order network models into a single multi-layered, multi-order model. To calculate the likelihood of such a model we can use all layers, thus avoiding the problem that we discard prefixes of paths. For each path, we start the calculation at a layer of order zero, which considers the relative probabilities of nodes. We then use this model layer to calculate the probability to observe the first node on a path. For the next transition to step two, we then use a first-order model. The next transition is calculated in the second-order model and so on, until we have reached the maximum order of our multi-order model.

If you drag the nodes, you will see that there is an attractive force between nodes $a$ and $f$ and $b$ and $g$, while the pairs across repel each other. Compared to the first-order layout above, this visualised the causal structures in the paths, while avoiding the problems of the higher-order layouts."
