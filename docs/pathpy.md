# pathpy Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will give an in-depth introduction to the Open Source python data analytics package `pathpy`. We illustrate the theoretical foundations of higher- and multi-order network models in toy examples, and we will demonstrate their advantages in real-world time series data on complex networks. The latest version of `pathpy` is publicly available via the [python package index](https://pypi.org/project/pathpy2/). You can simply install it by typing:

```
pip install pathpy2
```

`pathpy` is fully integrated with `jupyter` notebooks, providing in-line, interactive and dynamic visualisations of graphs and networks, temporal networks, as well as higher- and multi-order network models. This teaser video highlights some of its features:

Having completed the introduction to interactive data science with `python`, `Visual Studio Code`, and `jupyter` in [unit 1](https://github.com/IngoScholtes/csh2018-tutorial/blob/master/code/1_vscode_jupyter.py), this tutorial consists of seven units (20 - 30 minutes each). For each unit we provide a stand-alone HTML file, as well as a juypter notebook that you can download and run on your own machine. In unit 5 and 8 we invite you to use `pathpy` to explore higher- and multi-order models on your own.
