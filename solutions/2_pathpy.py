# 2 Introducing `pathpy`

In the introductory lecture we have seen that higher-order modelling, visualisation, and analysis techniques are useful to analyze **temporal network data** that provide us with **statistics of paths in complex networks**. But how can we apply higher-order network analytics to such such data in practice?

In this tutorial, I will introduce [``pathpy``](http://www.pathpy.net), an OpenSource `python` package that provides higher-order data analytics and representation learning techniques. It contains data structures, algorithms, data import/export methods, and visualisation techniques for various types of time series data on complex networks.

`pathpy` is pure `python` code with no platform-specific dependencies. It only depends on `numpy` and `scipy`, which come with `Anaconda`, so it should be very easy to install. In principle installing the latest 2.0 version of `pathpy` should be as easy as running

```
pip install pathpy2
```

on the terminal. In any case, you can find more detailed setup instructions on the [tutorial website](https://ingoscholtes.github.io/csh2018-tutorial/setup).

A core functionality of `pathpy` is to read, calculate, store, manipulate, and model path statistics extracted from different kinds of temporal data on complex networks. For this `pathpy` provides the class `Paths`, which can store collections of paths with varying lengths. All classes and methods in `pathpy` are documented using `python`'s docstring feature so we can access the documentation using the standard `help` function.

md("""
We now have an empty `Paths` instance `toy_paths` that we can use to add path statistics to generate a small toy example. We can add paths using the method `add_path`. As the first parameter, it accepts any iterable (list, string, etc.) of `string` variables (or objects that can be cast to `string)`, where each entry in the iterable is one step (i.e. node) on a path. The optional `frequency` parameter captures the number of times a specific path has been observed.

We get summary statistics of the `Paths` instance. Our toy example contains 10 observed paths between three nodes. These paths imply a graph topology with two edges `(a,b)` and `(b,c)`. Both the maximum and the average path length is two (the path length counts the number of edge traversals of a path).

To understand the last three lines and the second line in the output, we must look into the inner workings of `pathpy`. For the fitting of higher-order graphical models as well as for the representation learning algorithm, `pathpy` uses all path statistics available. Specifically to fit, say, a second-order model to a set of paths that all have length 10 or longer, we  calculate which paths of length two are contained as sub-paths within these observations of longer paths. For this reason, `pathpy` automatically calculates the statistics of actual path observations as well as the statistics of **sub-paths** contained in these observed paths.

In our case, we have $10$ observations of a single path $a \rightarrow b \rightarrow c$ of length two, thus the last line in the output above. Each of these paths additionally contains two sub-paths $a \rightarrow b$ and $b \rightarrow c$ of length two, thus the number $20.0$ in the sub-path count in the line $k=1$. Finally, each of the paths contains three "paths" of length zero, which are just observations of a single node (i.e. there is no transition across an edge), thus the sub-path count of $30.0$ in the line $k=0$. This amounts to a total of $50.0$ sub-paths + $10$ observations of an actual (longest) path, thus explaining the second line in the output.

Apart from adding paths as a tuple, we can also add them as string-encoded n-grams, using the parameter `separator` to specify a character that separates nodes.

md("""
We often analyse or visualise graph or network topologies in which the observed paths have occurred. For this, `pathpy` provides the class `Network`, which you can use to read, manipulate, analyse, and visualise directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted networks.

We can easily turn any `Paths` instance into a network by using the class method `Network.from_paths`. This will cut each path $v_0 \rightarrow v_1 \rightarrow v_2 \rightarrow \ldots$  into multiple directed *dyadic relations* $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ that are represented by directed edges.

We obtain a network with five nodes $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$ and four directed edges. The number of times each edge is traversed by a path is captured by the **weights** of these edges. We can access these weights using the dictionary `toy_graph.edges[edge]`.

In fact, since each edge can be viewed as a path of length one, the edge weights in our example are nothing more than the statistics of corresponding **sub-paths** of length one in the `toy_paths`. We can check the statistics of paths in a `Paths` instance by accessing `p.paths[length][path_tuple]`. This will return an array of two numbers, where the first entry is the number of times a path has been observed as **sub-path** of length l, and the second number gives the number of times a path has been observed as an **actual** (longest) path of length l.

md("""
When dealing with rich, real-world data we often want to store additional attributes of nodes and edges. `pathpy`'s  `Network` class accomodates for such settings by supporting arbitrary attributes both at the level of nodes and edges. Moreover, we can find nodes or edges with certain attributes by passing `lambda` functions to the `find_nodes` or `find_edges` method.

The attribute `x` of a node `v` or an edge `e` in a network instance `net` can be accessed simply by reading or writing to the dictionary net.nodes[v][x] and net.edges[e][x] respectively.

Finally, `pathpy` offers rich, interactive HTML5 visualisations of all of its internal objects that can also be shown inline in a `jupyter` notebook. To embed a visualisation of our example network in our notebook, we simply have to write the name of the variable as the last line of a `jupyter` cell. 

Note that you can interact with the generated graph using the mouse. We can drag nodes as well as pan and zoom. Hovering above a node will show the name of that node.
