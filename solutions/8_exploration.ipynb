In addition to the pathway data from session 1, we will consider data that we provide in the SQLite database `temporal_networks.db`.

    "- Generate higher-order visualisations of the US Flight and London Tube data and visually compare the graph layouts calculated for the first and optimal-order models.\n",
    "- Use the `MultiOrderModel` class to learn the optimal order of a temporal network. How does the detected optimal order change with the time scale $\\delta$ that you use in the extraction of causal paths?\n",
    "- Use the `MultiOrderModel` class to learn the optimal order of the London Tube data set. How does the detected optimal order compare to the prediction performance studied in exploration 1.4?\n",
    "- Study the change in the algebraic connectivity between the second-order model and the second-order null model for (i) a temporal network data set and (ii) the US Flights data.\n",
